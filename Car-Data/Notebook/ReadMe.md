## üìö Project Overview

This project focuses on **Car Analysis** and **Purchase Prediction** using Machine Learning. The goal is to develop a classification model that can predict whether a customer will purchase a car based on various factors such as Gender, age and Annual salary. The project includes data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation using Random Forest
classification algorithm.

### Problem Statement
Given a dataset with customer attributes. The task is to build a classification model that predicts whether a customer will buy a car or not. This can be particularly useful for car dealerships to understand customer behavior and improve sales strategies.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing patterns and trends in the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, categorical encoding, and scaling.
- **Model Selection**: Trying different classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC for evaluation.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the model's performance using techniques like GridSearchCV.
- **Prediction**: Predicting whether a customer will purchase a car based on input features.
